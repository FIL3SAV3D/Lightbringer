# Lightbringer
 A metroidvania game.

Lightbringer was a earlier game me and cheesieDUX, my best friend artist, worked together on. It was supposed to be a metroidvania game but we didn't get to far. It did teach me the basics of GD script however and also a bit about making character state machines. **Unfortunetly the project does not work properly and only the code remains as of now**. Will get back to it on a future date.
